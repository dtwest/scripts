# Scripts

This repo just contains a collection of scripts & config that I use to setup my base dev environment on new machines before running additional config scripts for either work / personal systems. 

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dtwest/scripts.git && \
cd scripts && \
. ./setup.sh
```

## Backing up config

```bash
backup_mac
## or 
. ./init.sh && backup_mac
```

## Can I use this?

If you want, you might not like the techno-colour rainbow, or other stuff, but sure.
